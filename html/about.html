          <h2>a word about us</h2>
          <p>
            This resturant was established way early. There was opportunity to explore and understand different cultures, cuisines and commercial models. During a stopover in Hong Kong in 1963, the twenty-something graduate was enjoying a quiet cup of coffee when inspiration struck and the founder decided to open a little Cafe in Allahabad. On his return from Tokyo, young he, discussed this idea with his father, a serial entrepreneur himself and his friends. His father gave the right encouragement, seed capitals of a few thousand rupees and a state-of-the-art Espresso machine that was serendipitously in his possession at the time.
          </p>

            this resturant has proudly partnered with the growth of this city and the several institutions that have come to its shores. The first outdoor catering managed by the founder in 1964. he tried the Pudding for the first time in 1965 made by our head Baker at the wedding of a prestigious businesman of India.
